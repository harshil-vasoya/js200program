    <!-- For example, if the given array nums was [2, 0, 3], the Gaussian Sum
        would be (3 * (3 + 1)) / 2, which is 6. (Why did we know that n = 3? Since
        only one number is missing from the array, and the array starts counting at 
        0, we know that the largest number, n, in the array is equal to the length of
        the array.) The actual sum of the digits in the array is 5 (2 + 0 + 3). The difference between the Gaussian sum and the actual sum is 1, which is our missing number. -->
    <script>
        nums = [2, 0, 3]
        function missingNumber(nums) {
            const gaussSum = (nums.length * (nums.length + 1)) / 2;
            const actualSum = nums.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
            return gaussSum - actualSum;
        }
        console.log(missingNumber(nums));

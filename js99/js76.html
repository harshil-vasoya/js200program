    <!-- Searching an Array, Two Ways -->
    <!-- For example, if the inputted array was [1, 2, 6, 8]
       and the target was 2, the function should return the
       output 1, because 2 is at the first index in the inputted array.
       If the inputted array was [1, 2, 6, 8] and the target was 4,
       the function should return the output 2, because in this ordered array,
       if we inserted 4 into it, it would be at index 2 (between numbers 2 and 6). -->

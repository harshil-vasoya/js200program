    <!-- For example, let's say you were given the array [8, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5] as the input,
         which is supposed to represent the price of a stock on each day. The best profit 
         you could make would be by buying stock on the second day (index 1), when the price
          was 1, and selling it on the fifth day (index 4), when the price was 6, for a 
          total max profit of 5 (6 - 1 = 5) -->
